#Truthtable

A little program i wrote to test if my 'one-liner' is working correctly.
Currently, i can only test my program with 4 ports. The idea is to make it so
that you can test it with < x amount of ports.

#installation (OS X)
```
git clone https://github.com/nathanbakhuijzen/truth-table.git
cd truth-table
make && ./displaytable
```

Paste this into your terminal, done.
